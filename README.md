# extension-run
run a program with any extension than exe, for example .doc(need valid program with changed extension). may not work for some programs(not my fault, but how runned program is made).

Initial and final version of simple program, which runs program passed to first arguments followed by arguments passed to program trying to run(not needed)
for example

runextension.exe C:\example\example.xy /arg1 -arg2

will run valid executable C:\example\example.xy passed with arguments /arg1 and -arg2
you do not need write additional arguments if not need. 1 argument with absolute path is needed. you can make shortcut to this program with arguments to be easier to run programs like that.
